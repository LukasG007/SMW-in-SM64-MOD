To Do:
1. Find memory that changes when SMW credits run (im sure there will be plenty)
2. Add in alerts that fit the channel theme for switching games (AUDIO: "YOU GOT A STARRRR" Video: some sort of template that looks like mario is playing smw inside peach's castle for the transition, and )
3. OBS stream source changes? (Could borrow from dougdoug's mario kart randomizer maybe)
4. Test compatability
5. Add some sort of dark souls "You Died" screen (id be fine to activate this one with my stream deck)
